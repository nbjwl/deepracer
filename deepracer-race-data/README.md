# The AWS DeepRacer Community Race Data Repository
The [AWS DeepRacer Community](https://deepracing.io) Race Data repository contains snapshots of data provided by the AWS DeepRacer service API.
It is updated at hourly intervals with the latest leaderboard and track updates.

Possible use cases are:
- Tracking submissions over time (how many people did submit in the virtual league?)
- Gaining insight in racer stats (how often did a racer submit?, how did the laptimes for a given racer improve over time?)
- Track stats (did racers get faster on a given track over time?)
